                    <p>
                    In 1905, at the age of 24, Hans Wilsdorf founded a company in London specializing in the distribution of timepieces. He began to dream of a watch worn on the wrist. Wristwatches were not very precise at the time, but Hans Wilsdorf foresaw that they could become not only elegant, but also reliable.The Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, which privately owns Rolex SA, is a registered Swiss charitable foundation and pays a lower tax rate.In 2011, a spokesman for Rolex declined to provide evidence regarding the amount of charitable donations made by the Wilsdorf Foundation, which brought up several scandals due to the lack of transparency In Geneva where the company is based, it is said to have gifted, among many things, two housing buildings to social institutions of Geneva.
                
                    According to the 2017 Brand Z report, the brand value is estimated at $8.053 billion. Rolex watches continue to have a reputation as status symbols. The company produces more than 1,000,000 timepieces each year.It is said that "The power of the Crown is never more felt than when trying to negotiate space in a retail environment for the product of another brand".</p>

                <td><h2>Elements of Rolex</h2>
                <p>Rolex uses a Platinum 950 alloy for its watches, which means the material is 95% pure platinum. It is mixed with ruthenium, which makes the prestigious precious metal even harder and shinier. The combination of Oystersteel with platinum 950 creates Rolesium, which is reserved solely for the Rolex Yacht-Master series.For those who can not decide whether to wear a gold or silver watch, Rolex has found the perfect solution: in 1933, the luxury company patented a combination of gold and stainless steel, which it called Rolesor. The materials used stay in contrast but at the same time harmonise each other, the perfect combination for anyone who likes it a bit more conspicuous. Bezel, winding crown and center elements of the bracelet are made of 18 kt gold or Everose gold, the center part of the case and the outer elements of the bracelet are made of stainless steel Oystersteel.</p></td>

                <h2>Value of Cost</h2>One of the central reasons for the high Rolex prices is certainly due to exclusivity. Rolex watches are not thrown onto the market by the millions, but are only produced in limited numbers. This leads to the fact that it is perceived as something very special to be able to call a Rolex his own.Rolex watches appreciate in value over time and some double in value the same day they're bought. If a Rolex is purchased new at MSRP, the value of that watch is instantly higher in today's market and historically goes up in price.</td>
